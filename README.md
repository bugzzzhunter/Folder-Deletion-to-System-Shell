 Folder Deletion to System Shell
 
 My attempt to learn some programming and try out post privilege folder deletion to System shell on windows by @jonasLyk 'https://secret.club/2020/04/23/directory-deletion-shell.html'.
 
 This script was tested on Windows10 x64 bit and issue was fixed by Windows in their release 'Version 10.0.19041.572'.
